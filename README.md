# Instructions

Clone this repository into `~/.dotfiles`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/anthropomorphic/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

and run

```
$ ~/.dotfiles/install.zsh
```

Installing this will create symlinks to `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` in your home
directory, so you will need to make sure that those files do not already exist.
